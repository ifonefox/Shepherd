          <h1>Help your doctor help you</h1>
          <p>Shepherd connects you directly to your doctor, so that the doctor can instantly see how your heart is doing. The doctor has instant access to the heart rates of all of their patients, so you know that you're health is always being monitored. With your consent and the installation of an app, your data is sent to the cloud so that your doctor can see a graph of your beats-per-minute from the last five minutes. It also detects if your heartbeat is faster than normal, and lets the doctor know.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Whenever someone's heart rate is abnormally fast, the interface changes to show the doctor the issue. Each person not only has his or her current BPM, but the doctor also sees a graph of your heart rate for the past five minutes. This allows the doctor to know if this is a single false positive, or the beginning of a problem.</p>

You don't need to worry about connecting a device to you computer, only to have all your data deleted. Since your watch is paired to your iPhone, you always have an Internet connection. Shepherd takes advantage of this, and sends the data to your doctor the instant after it is measured.</p>
